Typically leads to not having or losing prior friends, as I can attest to. Of course just because I have AvPD doesn't mean I don't want to have friends, in fact I would love to, I just don't have the capability to make/keep them. Try as I might, AvPD has a firm hold on me and I'm far too weak to break free. And who knows, I might also have some other disorders, but it's hard to get diagnosed when you're too scared to leave the house by yourself let alone talk to a stranger about your various issues...

It's something everyone wants, but that no one can get enough of. Every organism in this reality is subject to the laws of nature, the most constraining of which being time. Many of us attempt to deny our own fate, grasping for any extra grain of sand to add to the hourglass. Alas, it seems that such attempts always end in futility. At times, I imagine a world without said constraint on human lives. Would humanity flourish with endless time to carry out their desires? Or would they bring destruction to the very planet that gives them life before breaking free from the chains that hold them there? Whatever the case, we shall never know.",e(t),e(t),"Humans are truly a fascinating subject of study. I've devoted my life to understanding their species, but they always seem to surprise me. And believe me when I say, I've been doing these studies for an extensively long time. A length of time you'd probably think to be impossible. In fact, I couldn't put it into words. You see, I've bypassed the conventional laws of reality in such a way that my time alive cannot be quantified. Simply put, it's because unlike every other creature in this universe, the constraint of time doesn't affect me. Or to be more precise, it has no effect on me, and I can control its effect on every particle that's ever been conceived.",e(t),e(t),"It sounds fictional, I know. But, the plain and simple truth is that I can control time. And it's really not as glamorous as it sounds. You have the ability to explore as many possibilities in life as you want, and to an adventurous soul that might sound like a dream come true, but I am far from that. Maybe in my younger days, far before I came into contact with this affliction, in the blissful ignorance of youth I would have enjoyed this kind of ability. For a time, at least.",e(t),e(t),"Of course, I didn't really have the ideal childhood that my species typically would have, but I still shared the curiosity and playfulness of my kind's youth. Being a lab pet didn't absolve me of those characteristics like you'd expect. And that combination should have most definitely killed me. But now, here I am, eternally forever. Sometimes I wish it never happened, that instead of being a dumb little curious creature intent on causing as much trouble as possible, I had just opted to be lazy that day. Who knows what would have happened. But even with all my control over time, I can't do anything about myself. I'm forever frozen in my current age. I could alter my appearance, but that wouldn't help me forget all the knowledge I've accumulated throughout various lifetimes.",e(t),e(t),"So yeah, life everlasting isn't exactly all that. And the fact that I have to live it alone doesn't help. You'd think I'd be able to make anyone else live forever through my time manipulation, but it doesn't exactly work like that. Let me explain. I can slow down the effect of time on people. Sounds great, right? Except for the fact that I can only control time completely, not specifically. So, while they would age slower, they would also process information slower, heal slower, speak slower, every single thing that their cells do would happen at the slower rate that I chose. I can't give people the aging freeze that I have, as much as I wish that I could. The best I can do is pause someone and bring them to the past or future.",e(t),e(t),"This whole time control thing was an unintended side effect of what the scientists in the lab I lived in were working on. They were messing with powers they didn't fully understand, but they understood that they were on the verge of learning how to slow and eventually stop the process of aging entirely. But when you mess with reality bending tools, unintended things tend to happen. And yeah it was mostly my fault but let's be serious here, who decides to keep a pet in a high tech, space-faring laboratory? At the time I was just a regular earth animal that got abducted because some alien beings couldn't live without companionship. I don't understand how they couldn't foresee the possibility that I'd cause trouble, especially being an animal well-known for such.",e(t),e(t),"So now here I am, alone in the cosmos, with the universe at my whims, but no desire to interfere. I've spent my time until now learning about a vast array of helpful knowledge. I started with studying the deep hidden secrets of magic, mostly to be able to conjure different bodies for myself, but from there I learned of various further applications. Now I understand the practicality of a human body, with it typically being the one I prefer for working with delicate materials, like in technological applications. Also for communicating with others on Earth, since most find it strange when an animal is talking. Still, I can't help but find myself constantly coming back to my original body.",e(t),e(t),"I realize now that I have not once actually mentioned what creature I am. I guess it slipped my mind.

What may surprise you, however, is that cats are actually one of the most popular pets across the universe.

So I understand what it's like to have people always pushing you away..." Yeah, I could see that. He didn't mention the attitude, but I assumed that was just a product of how he was treated. If people always pushed him away, I couldn't blame him for being easily agitated.`,e(t),`"Right... I know what you mean. Well, I'm not exactly off-putting, but due to a lack of socializing in my youth, I have a hard time knowing what is appropriate to say and what isn't in a conversation. People end up thinking I'm just weird... Then I end up never seeing them again."`,e(t),`"That explains a lot. I was wondering why you randomly asked to sit with me, but now I think I get it. I feel as though you can see something in others that they themselves don't. That must be what drew you towards me, even though we had just had a bad interaction." This kid... There seemed to be a lot more to him than what was on the surface. I couldn't help but wonder how he had come to that conclusion so quickly, after just a few spoken sentences between us. He was intriguing, that much I could see from the very beginning, but the more I spoke to him, the more I wanted to understand everything about him. I was used to these feelings though, and I knew I'd probably end up regretting it if I acted on them.`,e(t),`"I guess so... I haven't really thought about it before, but you might be right. It does make sense though. If people hear something they aren't ready to accept, they'd definitely be more inclined to push me away... But that's assuming what I'm seeing truly is that and not anything else." I really hadn't considered it much, but everything he said made so much sense. "Where did you get this intuition of yours anyway? You seem to hit all the nails directly on their heads right away."`,e(t),`"Oh, I guess I can just tell..." He looked away from me as he said that, as though there was something more he wasn't letting on. Fair enough, we all have things we need to hide.`,e(t),`"That's some superpower." I meant this genuinely, but as soon as it came out of my mouth I realized it could seem sarcastic. I had a bit of a problem with saying sarcastic things that sounded serious and vice versa, which also contributed to my constant loss of friends.`,e(t),`"You could say that..." I noticed him looking dejected, and I realized I was doing it again. I was pushing the conversation to where it shouldn't be going. I hated myself for this; I didn't know how I always managed to go in this direction. I just wanted to continue the conversation, not make people feel bad about themselves.

Not really the sort of drink I would expect someone like him to get, but I wasn't going to judge.`,e(t),'"Uh... I wanted to see if we had similar tastes!

The transition sounded a bit off, but as long as I can keep it together from here on out, I should be perfectly fine. I looked down at my feet in anticipation of a response.',e(t),`"That's... kinda girly if you ask me." Says the person who got french vanilla. What do you expect me to drink? Straight black coffee? Sounds boring. Still, it was kinda funny. I looked up at him, suddenly noticing him smiling at me.`,e(t),'I eased up, and even laughed a bit. "Girly? Is that a problem?"
