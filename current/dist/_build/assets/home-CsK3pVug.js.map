It's something everyone wants, but that no one can get enough of. Every organism in this reality is subject to the laws of nature, the most constraining of which being time. Many of us attempt to deny our own fate, grasping for any extra grain of sand to add to the hourglass. Alas, it seems that such attempts always end in futility. At times, I imagine a world without said constraint on human lives. Would humanity flourish with endless time to carry out their desires? Or would they bring destruction to the very planet that gives them life before breaking free from the chains that hold them there? Whatever the case, we shall never know.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        Humans are truly a fascinating subject of study. I've devoted my life to understanding their species, but they always seem to surprise me. And believe me when I say, I've been doing these studies for an extensively long time. A length of time you'd probably think to be impossible. In fact, I couldn't put it into words. You see, I've bypassed the conventional laws of reality in such a way that my time alive cannot be quantified. Simply put, it's because unlike every other creature in this universe, the constraint of time doesn't affect me. Or to be more precise, it has no effect on me, and I can control its effect on every particle that's ever been conceived.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        It sounds fictional, I know. But, the plain and simple truth is that I can control time. And it's really not as glamorous as it sounds. You have the ability to explore as many possibilities in life as you want, and to an adventurous soul that might sound like a dream come true, but I am far from that. Maybe in my younger days, far before I came into contact with this affliction, in the blissful ignorance of youth I would have enjoyed this kind of ability. For a time, at least.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        Of course, I didn't really have the ideal childhood that my species typically would have, but I still shared the curiosity and playfulness of my kind's youth. Being a lab pet didn't absolve me of those characteristics like you'd expect. And that combination should have most definitely killed me. But now, here I am, eternally forever. Sometimes I wish it never happened, that instead of being a dumb little curious creature intent on causing as much trouble as possible, I had just opted to be lazy that day. Who knows what would have happened. But even with all my control over time, I can't do anything about myself. I'm forever frozen in my current age. I could alter my appearance, but that wouldn't help me forget all the knowledge I've accumulated throughout various lifetimes.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        So yeah, life everlasting isn't exactly all that. And the fact that I have to live it alone doesn't help. You'd think I'd be able to make anyone else live forever through my time manipulation, but it doesn't exactly work like that. Let me explain. I can slow down the effect of time on people. Sounds great, right? Except for the fact that I can only control time completely, not specifically. So, while they would age slower, they would also process information slower, heal slower, speak slower, every single thing that their cells do would happen at the slower rate that I chose. I can't give people the aging freeze that I have, as much as I wish that I could. The best I can do is pause someone and bring them to the past or future.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        This whole time control thing was an unintended side effect of what the scientists in the lab I lived in were working on. They were messing with powers they didn't fully understand, but they understood that they were on the verge of learning how to slow and eventually stop the process of aging entirely. But when you mess with reality bending tools, unintended things tend to happen. And yeah it was mostly my fault but let's be serious here, who decides to keep a pet in a high tech, space-faring laboratory? At the time I was just a regular earth animal that got abducted because some alien beings couldn't live without companionship. I don't understand how they couldn't foresee the possibility that I'd cause trouble, especially being an animal well-known for such.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        So now here I am, alone in the cosmos, with the universe at my whims, but no desire to interfere. I've spent my time until now learning about a vast array of helpful knowledge. I started with studying the deep hidden secrets of magic, mostly to be able to conjure different bodies for myself, but from there I learned of various further applications. Now I understand the practicality of a human body, with it typically being the one I prefer for working with delicate materials, like in technological applications. Also for communicating with others on Earth, since most find it strange when an animal is talking. Still, I can't help but find myself constantly coming back to my original body.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        I realize now that I have not once actually mentioned what creature I am. I guess it slipped my mind. I tend to assume people can guess from my demeanor, but seeing as this is a written memoir, it'd probably be a little more difficult than usual. In human terms, I am of the species that is known as the domestic cat. I assume that comes as no surprise. What may surprise you, however, is that cats are actually one of the most popular pets across the universe. Even though they originated on Earth, they've been abducted and bred, and promptly distributed across galaxies since. They are considered the universe's cutest animal. I understand completely, and I agree with the collective here. I am proud to call myself an Earth cat as well.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        I guess my abductors thought it'd be more authentic to get an Earth cat. Some space cats actually have some really cool evolutionary traits though. I may be getting a bit off topic here...\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        TO BE CONTINUED\r\n                    </Story>\r\n                </Match>\r\n                <Match when={store.selectedStory == \"dlq_charade\"}>\r\n                    <Story>\r\n                        Memory is really quite an interesting thing, wouldn't you say? At times, the most mundane scenes will be the ones to imprint into your mind, while important life events slip away from your memory. Why is that? It's a question I've always thought to be pretty intriguing. Although, that may be because I am in such a unique situation.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        You would probably find it hard to understand. I am who I am though, and there is unfortunately no changing that. Sometimes, I'm a monster, and other times, I'm a saint. Depending on which I undertake, my memories are unlocked and locked accordingly. At the moment, I have no desire to hurt anyone. But, who's to tell how long that moment will last?\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        You seem perplexed. I'm sorry, it was confusing, wasn't it? Let me help you understand, then.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        Sometimes, I'm a saint.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        And other times, I'm a monster.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        ...\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        This is such a drag. Why do people have to exist? They all die so easily. What purpose will they serve in death? It's almost as if they exist solely for me to kill them. The light in the eyes of today's target faded quicker than most. I guess he probably had less will to live inside of him. Well, whatever. The simple fact of the matter is that they all must die. The burning desire inside of me combined with my memories of the past leave me with no choice. Although, it's not that I don't enjoy it, I just don't like how I end up so exhausted after the switch back. Plus, who'd be able to enjoy it while knowing they're going to return to a powerless form in a few moments? It really takes away from being able to savor the kill.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        What a mess. I was just with that person, and now... he's gone. I'm sorry. I truly wish for forgiveness, but I don't deserve it. I need to die, or be isolated, permanently, but he won't let either of those things happen. I have so little control...\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        There's really no reason for so many people to die. But, somehow, I ended up becoming an assassin... I knew I had to kill that guy, but I didn't want to, and I couldn't find a reason to, other than that it was my task. That monster though, he needs no reason. In fact, he doesn't want one. Just getting to kill makes him feel fulfilled, no matter who it is. So many have died by his hands, the hands I share. Does that make it my fault too?\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        It's my job to kill, and I go through with all that I'm tasked. Just because I make him do the actual killing doesn't mean I share no blame. I took this job because I knew he would kill whether it was his job or not, but participating in this sort of career in any way incriminates you, both legally and morally. All I can do is hold him back until the time comes, but I barely even manage that.\r\n                    </Story>\r\n                </Match>\r\n                <Match when={store.selectedStory == \"dlq_riot\"}>\r\n                    <Story>\r\n                        The crazy guy with the shotgun? Yeah, I saw him. I wish I hadn't. Seriously dude; if looks could kill, not a single person in the world would be left alive. His whole body just gave off this aura that screamed danger, and seeing his face only multiplied that feeling. Remembering it sends a shiver down my spine...\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        Me and a couple of my buddies were sent to check out some disturbance this rando was causing on the edge of our turf, and there he was. No one with me knew him, but afterwards I learned he had been pretty notorious in his hometown for spewing nonsense and causing a ruckus. And yeah, he lived up to that reputation pretty well.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        When we arrived, he was standing on top of a derelict pumpjack, shouting about how his last gang kicked him out because he was crazy. I can't say I was surprised to hear that. He wasn't spouting complete lunacy, but it was the sort of thing that no sane person would have let get past being simply a train of thought.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        If I recall correctly, this is what he had said: \"Oh god, why have I been forsaken so? If there is any God in this cruel world, how dare he abandon me at my lowest?! How very sad... Such a tragedy has never been told, such a lamentation has never been written! My life is its own cinematic failure... A box office joke. They'd laugh me out of the circus if I applied... Who other than I could get kicked out of a gang for being a lunatic? I was under the impression that those idiotic enough to join a gang were already crazy. What a fool I was, a complete nimrod! Wait, why is nimrod a term for a fool anyway? Wasn't he pretty smart? His only mistake was challenging God, but... Challenging the limits of human knowledge is how our species have made it this far... Ughhh... This makes no sense!!!\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        ...Yeah, that was about it. I tried to do my best impression of him, but I kinda just sounded like an idiot... Although, it was an idiot I was imitating, so I guess I nailed it?\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        Normally, we would've handled this easily, but the guy was carrying a shotgun like it was just an everyday commodity. And for all we knew, if one of us looked at him the wrong way, they'd have been shot dead immediately. Oh, and talking with him was going nowhere. So, in an effort to silence him, we had decided to take a few precautions. Since he didn't look very bright, we just figured we'd have someone get the jump on him. I think that was our first and biggest mistake.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        It's like he had planned out all of our possible moves. Every time we tried to come at him from a different angle, he had already countered us. This guy was surrounded by 6 or 7 people, yet he was the one backing us into a proverbial corner. We realized then that we weren't gonna be able to lay a finger on him. We backed off, then he told us that we shouldn't interrupt a lunatic's lament, and proceeded to blab on and on about how rude we were.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        You won't hear me admit to this often, but he was completely out of our league. He was just... so crazily stupid and yet so idiotically strategic. We left him alone after that.\r\n                    </Story>\r\n                </Match>\r\n                <Match when={store.selectedStory == \"dlq_focus\"}>\r\n                    <Story>\r\n                        Hit. Pull back, reload. Hit. Pull back, reload. Hit. Pull back, reload. Miss. Pull back, reload. Oh great, I'm out of ammo. Sigh. The certainty of a sniper should be unbeatable, but I always find myself doubting my skill. At least I can have confidence that the fault is my own, and not the bullet or the gun itself.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        I've spent the last few years indulging in a few different hobbies, but the one that I've always stuck to is marksmanship. When I was younger, I couldn't handle firearms, so I opted to spend my time practicing with a bow and arrow. Doing that for so long prepared me to have a steady aim with a sniper rifle, and I've since won a couple of contests with this sort of skill. But I still haven't reached the level of proficiency that I want.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        Do I hunt? No, not really. I understand how hunting animals might provide a change of pace for some, but there are ways to set up erratic targets instead of having to kill innocent creatures. Yeah, I'm pretty unlike most in my profession. For a sniper, I'm pretty pathetic. They're known for their ability to assassinate people from afar, but I'm not interested in killing. Even with a genuine reason, I still don't think I could bring myself to do it.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        You see, when it comes to things like that, I have to be completely convinced it's the right thing to do. If I even have the slightest doubt in myself, I lose my composure, and everything starts going wrong. So, I spend all my time thinking about everything going on. I have to come to my own conclusions as early as possible. That way, I can make the important decisions when the time comes.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        It's smart? I wouldn't necessarily say that. It means I cannot rely on my own guts or whims at all, and there are times where gut feelings are the best options. If something comes up suddenly that I haven't thought about before, I'll waste time pondering over all the best options, all while time passes me by. Seriously, it really sucks when that happens. People I've known really despised me for it, and I couldn't understand where they were coming from. This has been my whole life, so I can't fathom having the ability to make instant decisions.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        I think about all sorts of stuff all of the time. I love learning and all that; history is something I especially enjoy. I mean, history doesn't change, but so many things in our everyday life do. It's hard to have confidence in anything current, because it all changes. That's why I focus so much on refining my marksmanship. It's something that has a large amount of constants and a small amount of variables. Plus, the main varying factor is myself, which helps me prove that I am capable of changing things.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        It's stuff like that which helps me find my place in life. I'm not perfectly content where I am now, but it's still fairly comfortable. I think I prefer life without change, and it's been like this for a while, so that adds to my comfort.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        - A Chat With a Local Sniper, [REDACTED] Newspaper\r\n                    </Story>\r\n                </Match>\r\n                <Match when={store.selectedStory == \"dreams\"}>\r\n                    <Story>\r\n                        I keep having these dreams. And in these dreams, I see you. But you're not you. You're what I wished you were.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        Sometimes my mind mistakes these dreams for memories of reality. It's days like those when I forget that I'm alone. But eventually, the truth starts to bleed back into my life. I'm forced to come to terms with how bad things actually are.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        I usually try to keep my head in thoughts of a better place. Imagining an existence in endless fantasy keeps me from dwelling on the darkness. And in that respect, these dreams make sense. My brain is simply trying to protect me from my greatest fears.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        But they become a problem. Not being able to discern what is real and what is fake makes it hard to live normally. So I learn to take caution with every step, question every movement, second guess every thought. It's simply the only way I can continue on.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        Knowing I can't trust my senses comes with its own problems. It's difficult to carry on without having anything to rely on, but I've devised workarounds. Still, every now and then, I get a glimpse of what I'm blocking out. These unspeakable horrors-\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        I keep having these nightmares. And in these nightmares, you're not there. Everyone's gone. And then I never wake up.\r\n                    </Story>\r\n                </Match>\r\n                <Match when={store.selectedStory == \"fuel2fire\"}>\r\n                    <Story>\r\n                        The year was coming to an end.\r\n                        A man worked tirelessly to prepare for winter.\r\n                        He had amassed an impossibly large stack of logs to satisfy his communal campfire all season long.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        The cold days dawned, and their nights were long.\r\n                        His campfire treated its guests well.\r\n                        The man was careful to tell them to only take the logs from the top in order to ensure the stack's stability.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        Not all guests were eager to listen.\r\n                        Some were lazy and selfish, quietly picking the most appealing log, and yanking it from the stack with haste.\r\n                        The stack quickly became less and less stable, until finally the last load-bearing log was pulled.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        It all came crashing down.\r\n                        The guests fled in terror as the logs rolled towards the campfire, setting the forest ablaze in mere moments.\r\n                        Its days of peace and tranquility were over.\r\n                    </Story>\r\n                </Match>\r\n                <Match when={store.selectedStory == \"friend\"}>\r\n                    <Story>\r\n                        I sighed as I tapped my foot impatiently. I knew I had a long day ahead of me. I checked my watch. It had just turned 5 PM, and I was still sitting alone at my table. Where could he be? I had plans with a friend today, but it seemed he was running late. I checked my phone. The lock screen was still as empty as ever. Why do people always blow me off? I decided I was fed up, and got up to leave the coffee shop we had planned to meet at.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        I walked towards the exit with my head drooping slightly. I'll admit I was disappointed, but not surprised. This sort of thing was something I was used to, unfortunately. I couldn't waste any more time waiting for a \"friend\" to show up an hour after our agreed meeting time. I, of course, wouldn't mention my disappointment to him. My resentment would just slowly build up over time until I couldn't hold it in anymore, and then my friend would have his excuse to finally stop socializing with me. Well, whatever. If that's what happens, then I guess that's just how it was meant to be. I genuinely tried to further our relationship, but friendships aren't just one-sided. If one person doesn't want that, it's impossible to force it. They'll just deteriorate over time, until they finally dissolve.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        I couldn't help but wonder whether or not it was my fault. I have a bad habit of oversharing about my life, which tends to scare people off. I wasn't trying to be self-absorbed, I just don't have the opportunity to talk about my own sorry life much. If someone gives me an inch, I end up unintentionally taking a mile. I felt worse after coming to that conclusion, but I convinced myself I deserved it. God, I'm such an idiot.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        As I walked through the exit of the coffee shop, I felt my shoulder get pushed out of the way. I looked up at the culprit beside me. It was a tall kid, probably about my own age, who had a scowl on his face as his gaze met mine.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Watch it, kid.\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        Oh, great. That's the kind of person I had bumped into. \"Sorry, I guess.\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Just don't let it happen again.\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        I don't know what was going on in this person's head, but I couldn't imagine ever even seeing him again, let alone bumping into him. \"Chill out, man. It was an honest mistake.\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Are you trying to start something?\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Look, I was just thinking about some stuff, not paying much attention to the outside world. You can't expect everyone to cater to you in life.\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"That's not what I'm saying.\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Huh?\" This guy really was an odd one, but that suddenly gave me an idea.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"This isn't some high and mighty lesson about life. It's just another altercation between strangers. It can either go one way or the other. So don't give me that crap. I doubt you want to be pissing off the wrong people.\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        I got the point of what he was saying, though it sorta seemed out of place for a guy like him. I wasn't trying to act deep or anything, so I immediately changed the subject. \"I guess that's true. Say, did you come here to meet someone?\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"What?\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"I'm just curious, that's all.\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Uhhhh... No? Though I don't understand why you're asking that all of a sudden.\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Well, my friend I had planned on meeting here bailed on me without even letting me know, and I was pretty annoyed about it...\" It also made me want to cry, but I wasn't going to tell someone I had just met that. \"Maybe we could get to know each other? I just need something to take my mind off of it.\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"...You're a pretty weird kid. But I don't really mind, so go ahead.\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Hey, I doubt you're much older than me.\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"I'm 21, you?\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"...Same.\" I knew it.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Oh. Well, you're just so short it was hard to imagine you were older than 18.\" I'm nearly average height. This guy is like 7 feet or something. Everyone's gonna be short to him.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Right... Well, whatever. You go get your coffee ordered, I'll find us a place to sit.\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        We went our separate ways for about 5 minutes until he was done ordering and sat down across from me. I was quite interested in knowing more about this guy's life as I was certain it was more interesting than mine.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        Chapter 2\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n\r\n                        \"So... what brings you to this coffee shop anyway? You go often?\" I didn't really know the best way to start a conversation, so I chose the most bland and typical approach.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Actually, this is my first time coming here. A friend told me it was pretty good a while back, but I never got around to going until now. Although... I only went today as a memorial for him... You see, he was in an accident a few days ago, and well... He passed away yesterday.\" Wow. I definitely wasn't expecting that, though I can't say I didn't suspect something was up. He wore the face of someone who had recently experienced tragedy. I knew this because it was the same expression I wore every day of my high school life.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"I'm sorry to hear that... I wish I could say more, but I usually hurt more than I help when I try to comfort people... So I'd rather not say too much...\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Yeah, it's fine... I get that... I really do.\" This guy suddenly seemed a lot more approachable than he was 10 minutes ago. \"I'm kinda off-putting to most people I meet, partly because of my height, and also because I tend to always have an unkind expression on my face. So I understand what it's like to have people always pushing you away...\" Yeah, I could see that. He didn't mention the attitude, but I assumed that was just a product of how he was treated. If people always pushed him away, I couldn't blame him for being easily agitated.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Right... I know what you mean. Well, I'm not exactly off-putting, but due to a lack of socializing in my youth, I have a hard time knowing what is appropriate to say and what isn't in a conversation. People end up thinking I'm just weird... Then I end up never seeing them again.\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"That explains a lot. I was wondering why you randomly asked to sit with me, but now I think I get it. I feel as though you can see something in others that they themselves don't. That must be what drew you towards me, even though we had just had a bad interaction.\" This kid... There seemed to be a lot more to him than what was on the surface. I couldn't help but wonder how he had come to that conclusion so quickly, after just a few spoken sentences between us. He was intriguing, that much I could see from the very beginning, but the more I spoke to him, the more I wanted to understand everything about him. I was used to these feelings though, and I knew I'd probably end up regretting it if I acted on them.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"I guess so... I haven't really thought about it before, but you might be right. It does make sense though. If people hear something they aren't ready to accept, they'd definitely be more inclined to push me away... But that's assuming what I'm seeing truly is that and not anything else.\" I really hadn't considered it much, but everything he said made so much sense. \"Where did you get this intuition of yours anyway? You seem to hit all the nails directly on their heads right away.\"\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Oh, I guess I can just tell...\" He looked away from me as he said that, as though there was something more he wasn't letting on. Fair enough, we all have things we need to hide.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"That's some superpower.\" I meant this genuinely, but as soon as it came out of my mouth I realized it could seem sarcastic. I had a bit of a problem with saying sarcastic things that sounded serious and vice versa, which also contributed to my constant loss of friends.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"You could say that...\" I noticed him looking dejected, and I realized I was doing it again. I was pushing the conversation to where it shouldn't be going. I hated myself for this; I didn't know how I always managed to go in this direction. I just wanted to continue the conversation, not make people feel bad about themselves. I knew I had to change the subject, but the hard part was figuring out how to integrate it seamlessly, without making it seem like I was forcing him to stop talking about it.\r\n\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        Chapter 3\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n\r\n\r\n                        \"Oh, um... I was wondering, what kind of coffee did you get?\" Drat. That sounded absolutely terrible. I wanted to just lock myself away from the world and hide, but I didn't really have that option here.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"...I just got a french vanilla cappuccino, why?\" Not really the sort of drink I would expect someone like him to get, but I wasn't going to judge.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Uh... I wanted to see if we had similar tastes! When I was waiting for my friend, I got an iced caramel latte. Oh, and I finished it long before you got here.\" I think this was going in a better direction... The transition sounded a bit off, but as long as I can keep it together from here on out, I should be perfectly fine. I looked down at my feet in anticipation of a response.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"That's... kinda girly if you ask me.\" Says the person who got french vanilla. What do you expect me to drink? Straight black coffee? Sounds boring. Still, it was kinda funny. I looked up at him, suddenly noticing him smiling at me.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        I eased up, and even laughed a bit. \"Girly? Is that a problem?\" I subconsciously twirled my hair thinking about it.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Uh... Well, no... I just thought it was a surprising choice. I usually feel pressured to just choose whatever people would expect me to get. I got the french vanilla cappuccino this time because that's what my friend would've got...\" I somehow steered the conversation in the wrong direction this time. Maybe I can still get out of it though...\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"I lived most of my life doing what others expected of me, and it only made me feel like I didn't have my own personality... I'm not trying to dictate your life, but you should never let others pressure you into taking your freedom of choice away...\" I hope that didn't sound too forceful.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Yeah... you're totally right. It's something I'd like to change about myself. I just find it so hard to actually try and make that change.\" That was something I completely understood. But I wanted to see if I could help him.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"You don't have to do it alone...\" Maybe that was a bit too forward, but it was the truth.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"I guess, but even then, I doubt I'd make any meaningful progress.\" I couldn't have related more.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        \"Well, you don't have to rush straight into it. ‘Good things take time', or however the quote goes. Hey, why don't we exchange numbers? I'd definitely like to talk at another time, and it'd allow me to help out in your life when I can.\" There we go. I somehow managed to ask for his number. This was a rarity for me; I pretty much never talked to strangers, let alone asked for their number. But I had taken quite a liking to this guy, and I didn't want this conversation to go to waste.\r\n\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        Chapter 4\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        <br />\r\n\r\n                        \"Hm... Why not? I mean, it couldn't hurt! I could always use a few new friends.\" It actually worked? I guess that's what most people do to find friends, so I probably shouldn't be surprised. Yet, with my outstanding single digit tally of the total friends I had made in person, I felt ecstatic.\r\n                        <br />\r\n                        We exchanged numbers, and talked for a bit longer.

I'm a 20 year old catboy who also happens to be gay as hell! Oh, and I also have Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD). Might also have some other disorders, but its hard to get diagnosed when you're too scared to leave the house by yourself let alone talk to a stranger about your various issues... ANYWAYS! Due to such issues I live with my parents and don't have a full time job, although I do work once per week for my older brother as a full-stack developer. In my free time I typically indulge in one of my many hobbies.</div>\r\n                                    <div class=\"border-t border-b border-dashed border-white text-lg\">Hobbies:</div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <ul class=\"list-disc ml-5\">\r\n                                            <li>making games</li>\r\n                                            <li>playing games</li>\r\n                                            <li>writing stories</li>\r\n                                            <li>cooking</li>\r\n                                            <li>listening to music (i listen to A LOT)</li>\r\n                                            <li>browsing art (especially anything cat related)</li>\r\n                                            <li>programming</li>\r\n                                            <li>building lego sets</li>\r\n                                        </ul>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div class=\"border-t border-b border-dashed border-white text-lg\">Minor Interests:</div>\r\n                                    <ul class=\"list-disc ml-5\">\r\n                                        <li>astronomy</li>\r\n                                        <li>photography</li>\r\n                                        <li>drawing</li>\r\n                                        <li>collecting records/CDs</li>\r\n                                    </ul>\r\n                                </TabsContent>\r\n                                <TabsContent value=\"social\">\r\n                                    <div>I pretty much only have bluesky and discord.
