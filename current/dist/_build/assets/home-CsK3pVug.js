It's something everyone wants, but that no one can get enough of. Every organism in this reality is subject to the laws of nature, the most constraining of which being time. Many of us attempt to deny our own fate, grasping for any extra grain of sand to add to the hourglass. Alas, it seems that such attempts always end in futility. At times, I imagine a world without said constraint on human lives. Would humanity flourish with endless time to carry out their desires? Or would they bring destruction to the very planet that gives them life before breaking free from the chains that hold them there? Whatever the case, we shall never know.",e(t),e(t),"Humans are truly a fascinating subject of study. I've devoted my life to understanding their species, but they always seem to surprise me. And believe me when I say, I've been doing these studies for an extensively long time. A length of time you'd probably think to be impossible. In fact, I couldn't put it into words. You see, I've bypassed the conventional laws of reality in such a way that my time alive cannot be quantified. Simply put, it's because unlike every other creature in this universe, the constraint of time doesn't affect me. Or to be more precise, it has no effect on me, and I can control its effect on every particle that's ever been conceived.",e(t),e(t),"It sounds fictional, I know. But, the plain and simple truth is that I can control time. And it's really not as glamorous as it sounds. You have the ability to explore as many possibilities in life as you want, and to an adventurous soul that might sound like a dream come true, but I am far from that. Maybe in my younger days, far before I came into contact with this affliction, in the blissful ignorance of youth I would have enjoyed this kind of ability. For a time, at least.",e(t),e(t),"Of course, I didn't really have the ideal childhood that my species typically would have, but I still shared the curiosity and playfulness of my kind's youth. Being a lab pet didn't absolve me of those characteristics like you'd expect. And that combination should have most definitely killed me. But now, here I am, eternally forever. Sometimes I wish it never happened, that instead of being a dumb little curious creature intent on causing as much trouble as possible, I had just opted to be lazy that day. Who knows what would have happened. But even with all my control over time, I can't do anything about myself. I'm forever frozen in my current age. I could alter my appearance, but that wouldn't help me forget all the knowledge I've accumulated throughout various lifetimes.",e(t),e(t),"So yeah, life everlasting isn't exactly all that. And the fact that I have to live it alone doesn't help. You'd think I'd be able to make anyone else live forever through my time manipulation, but it doesn't exactly work like that. Let me explain. I can slow down the effect of time on people. Sounds great, right? Except for the fact that I can only control time completely, not specifically. So, while they would age slower, they would also process information slower, heal slower, speak slower, every single thing that their cells do would happen at the slower rate that I chose. I can't give people the aging freeze that I have, as much as I wish that I could. The best I can do is pause someone and bring them to the past or future.",e(t),e(t),"This whole time control thing was an unintended side effect of what the scientists in the lab I lived in were working on. They were messing with powers they didn't fully understand, but they understood that they were on the verge of learning how to slow and eventually stop the process of aging entirely. But when you mess with reality bending tools, unintended things tend to happen. And yeah it was mostly my fault but let's be serious here, who decides to keep a pet in a high tech, space-faring laboratory? At the time I was just a regular earth animal that got abducted because some alien beings couldn't live without companionship. I don't understand how they couldn't foresee the possibility that I'd cause trouble, especially being an animal well-known for such.",e(t),e(t),"So now here I am, alone in the cosmos, with the universe at my whims, but no desire to interfere. I've spent my time until now learning about a vast array of helpful knowledge. I started with studying the deep hidden secrets of magic, mostly to be able to conjure different bodies for myself, but from there I learned of various further applications. Now I understand the practicality of a human body, with it typically being the one I prefer for working with delicate materials, like in technological applications. Also for communicating with others on Earth, since most find it strange when an animal is talking. Still, I can't help but find myself constantly coming back to my original body.",e(t),e(t),"I realize now that I have not once actually mentioned what creature I am. I guess it slipped my mind. I tend to assume people can guess from my demeanor, but seeing as this is a written memoir, it'd probably be a little more difficult than usual. In human terms, I am of the species that is known as the domestic cat. I assume that comes as no surprise. What may surprise you, however, is that cats are actually one of the most popular pets across the universe. Even though they originated on Earth, they've been abducted and bred, and promptly distributed across galaxies since. They are considered the universe's cutest animal. I understand completely, and I agree with the collective here. I am proud to call myself an Earth cat as well.",e(t),e(t),"I guess my abductors thought it'd be more authentic to get an Earth cat.

There seemed to be a lot more to him than what was on the surface. I couldn't help but wonder how he had come to that conclusion so quickly, after just a few spoken sentences between us. He was intriguing, that much I could see from the very beginning, but the more I spoke to him, the more I wanted to understand everything about him. I was used to these feelings though, and I knew I'd probably end up regretting it if I acted on them.`,e(t),`"I guess so... I haven't really thought about it before, but you might be right. It does make sense though. If people hear something they aren't ready to accept, they'd definitely be more inclined to push me away... But that's assuming what I'm seeing truly is that and not anything else." I really hadn't considered it much, but everything he said made so much sense. "Where did you get this intuition of yours anyway? You seem to hit all the nails directly on their heads right away."`,e(t),`"Oh, I guess I can just tell..." He looked away from me as he said that, as though there was something more he wasn't letting on. Fair enough, we all have things we need to hide.`,e(t),`"That's some superpower." I meant this genuinely, but as soon as it came out of my mouth I realized it could seem sarcastic. I had a bit of a problem with saying sarcastic things that sounded serious and vice versa, which also contributed to my constant loss of friends.`,e(t),`"You could say that..." I noticed him looking dejected, and I realized I was doing it again. I was pushing the conversation to where it shouldn't be going. I hated myself for this; I didn't know how I always managed to go in this direction. I just wanted to continue the conversation, not make people feel bad about themselves. I knew I had to change the subject, but the hard part was figuring out how to integrate it seamlessly, without making it seem like I was forcing him to stop talking about it.`,e(t),e(t),"Chapter 3",e(t),e(t),`"Oh, um... I was wondering, what kind of coffee did you get?" Drat. That sounded absolutely terrible. I wanted to just lock myself away from the world and hide, but I didn't really have that option here.`,e(t),`"...I just got a french vanilla cappuccino, why?" Not really the sort of drink I would expect someone like him to get, but I wasn't going to judge.`,e(t),'"Uh... I wanted to see if we had similar tastes! When I was waiting for my friend, I got an iced caramel latte. Oh, and I finished it long before you got here." I think this was going in a better direction... The transition sounded a bit off, but as long as I can keep it together from here on out, I should be perfectly fine. I looked down at my feet in anticipation of a response.',e(t),`"That's... kinda girly if you ask me." Says the person who got french vanilla. What do you expect me to drink? Straight black coffee? Sounds boring. Still, it was kinda funny. I looked up at him, suddenly noticing him smiling at me.`,e(t),'I eased up, and even laughed a bit. "Girly? Is that a problem?" I subconsciously twirled my hair thinking about it.',e(t),`"Uh... Well, no... I just thought it was a surprising choice. I usually feel pressured to just choose whatever people would expect me to get. I got the french vanilla cappuccino this time because that's what my friend would've got..." I somehow steered the conversation in the wrong direction this time. Maybe I can still get out of it though...`,e(t),`"I lived most of my life doing what others expected of me, and it only made me feel like I didn't have my own personality... I'm not trying to dictate your life, but you should never let others pressure you into taking your freedom of choice away..." I hope that didn't sound too forceful.`,e(t),`"Yeah... you're totally right. It's something I'd like to change about myself. I just find it so hard to actually try and make that change." That was something I completely understood. But I wanted to see if I could help him.`,e(t),`"You don't have to do it alone..." Maybe that was a bit too forward, but it was the truth.`,e(t),`"I guess, but even then, I doubt I'd make any meaningful progress." I couldn't have related more.`,e(t),`"Well, you don't have to rush straight into it. ‘Good things take time', or however the quote goes. Hey, why don't we exchange numbers? I'd definitely like to talk at another time, and it'd allow me to help out in your life when I can." There we go. I somehow managed to ask for his number. This was a rarity for me; I pretty much never talked to strangers, let alone asked for their number. But I had taken quite a liking to this guy, and I didn't want this conversation to go to waste.`,e(t),e(t),"Chapter 4",e(t),e(t),`"Hm... Why not? I mean, it couldn't hurt! I could always use a few new friends." It actually worked? I guess that's what most people do to find friends, so I probably shouldn't be surprised. Yet, with my outstanding single digit tally of the total friends I had made in person, I felt ecstatic.`,e(t),"We exchanged numbers, and talked for a bit longer. Sadly, I had to go home to finish up some work I had been putting off, so we said our goodbyes and I promised him I'd message him as soon as I could.
